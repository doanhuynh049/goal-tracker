## 🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Creating Hierarchical Goals:
```java
GoalService service = new GoalService();

// Create long-term goal (2-3 years)
Goal longTerm = service.createLongTermGoal(
    "Become Software Architect", 
    "Advance to senior architect role", 
    2027
);

// Create year goal under long-term goal
Goal yearGoal = service.createYearGoal(
    longTerm, 
    "Master System Design", 
    "Learn advanced architecture patterns", 
    2025
);

// Create month goal under year goal
Goal monthGoal = service.createMonthGoal(
    yearGoal, 
    "Complete Microservices Course", 
    "Finish online course", 
    8, 2025
);

// Add tasks to month goal
monthGoal.addTask("Watch lectures", LocalDate.now(), LocalDate.now().plusDays(7));
monthGoal.addTask("Complete labs", LocalDate.now().plusDays(8), LocalDate.now().plusDays(14));
```

### Progress Calculation:
- **Task Completion** → Updates month goal progress
- **Month Goal Progress** → Updates year goal progress  
- **Year Goal Progress** → Updates long-term goal progress
